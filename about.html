						<p> Hi my name is Jessie Paulson! Welcome to my website. I am a graduate of UW-Madison with degrees in Environmental Studies, Cartography and GIS, and Political Science. I am well versed in ESRI technologies 
						such as ArcGIS Desktop, Pro, and Online, as well as Adobe Creative Suite, QGIS, ENVI, ERDAS, CSS, Java, and Python. I have practiced my technical skillset through on-the-job training, previous academic study, and internship experiences.  </p>
						 <p>Most recently, I was a Geospatial Analyst for Radiant Solutions where I was fortunate to work on several different project teams.  Two significant projects on which I’ve contributed have been land cover products and the testing and 
						 evaluation of a new, in-house digitizing software. Working with aerial imagery from Digital Globe and Sentinel satellites, I help to identify, collect, manage, and correct land cover and land use classifications in order to run spatial
						 analysis in ERDAS Imagine and ultimately produce global-scale applications. In the testing of new software, I started using the software in a pilot project focused on feature extraction. For the pilot, we were tasked with evaluating the
						 benefits and disadvantaged of using the in-house software versus JOSM, an open-source program. Most recently, I have used this new software to map the ocean shoreline along southern coast of Africa. In each of these projects, I have not 
						 only studied the aerial imagery but also conducted research using classified and unclassified data sources to locate and analyze natural and man-made features. 
						</p>
						<p> In addition to my work experience, I believe my academic preparation contributes to the strength of my candidacy. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I completed three majors in four years. My cartographic skills range from creating 
						terrain maps and long-form infographics to tile-design and web mapping applications. I also gained experience using aerial imagery in ENVI, studied and mapped data using QGIS and ArcGIS, and have had practice in research using different online 
						tools such as the UGSG aerial imagery library, the Census Bureau demographic data, and open source data like Natural Earth and JOSM. 
						</p>
						<p>Furthermore, my internships and assistantships have prepared me well for many opportunities. I was the aerial imagery intern at the SILVIS Lab in the Department of Forestry and Wildlife during my senior year at UW where we worked with the USFS 
						to complete research into the rebuilding rates of houses after wildfires. To evaluate the houses, my team and I analyzed the current and historical imagery in order to digitize the burned, untouched, and rebuilt houses in areas of previous large 
						wildfires. In the summer of 2016, I prepared maps about DC’s development as the Research and GIS Intern at Washington DC Economic Partnership (WDCEP). For one specific map, I created during my time at WDCEP, I conducted research into the redevelopment
						efforts of DC neighborhoods and complied it into a map illustrating over 50 historical properties within commercial and industrial zones in DC that either could be or have been repurposed for new uses. It was then highlighted on their website as their 
						“Map of the Month” for July. Many of these projects referenced you can find on my website. Feel free to contact me with any question and/or comments. Thanks for stopping by!
