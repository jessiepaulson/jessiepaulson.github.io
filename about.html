						<p> Hi my name is Jessie Paulson and I am a recent graduate from UW-Madison 
						with degrees in Environmental Studies, Cartography and GIS, and Political Science. 
						I am well versed in ESRI technologies such as ArcGIS Desktop, Pro, and Online, as well as Adobe Creative Suite, 
						QGIS, ENVI, CSS, and Python. I have learned and practiced many of these technologies by creating terrain maps, tile design maps, web map applications, and 
						other infographic maps. In addition to my application skillset, I have had practice in research using different online tools such as the UGSG aerial imagery library,
						 the Census Bureau demographic data, and open source like Natural Earth sets for many maps and projects. </p>
						 <p>For example, this past fall, my Geography Capstone Project was focused on 
						 following racial segregation and discrimination in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The project tracked the patterns of settlement, the drivers of these patterns, and the processes of housing 
						 segregation and policy which affected four specific neighborhoods in Milwaukee. My group then completed a secondary project this spring where we conducted more varied and extensive 
						 tests to identify neighborhoods driven by race, income, both race and income or neither for the larger city extents. This allowed us to further understand the interactions between race 
						 and income in Milwaukee, confirmed our conclusions made in the capstone, and present this data at the Midwest Undergraduate Geography Symposium. 
						 I also have experience in ENVI and using aerial imagery as I completed a research project analyzing aerial photography for Hanoi, Vietnam in my remote sensing courses. The project
						  focused on Hanoi’s urban transformation, the resulting land use changes, and the potentially necessary policy changes needed for this type of urban growth. 
						</p>
						<p>In addition to my academic preparations and computer skills, I believe my internship positions contribute to the strength of my candidacy. I was the aerial imagery intern at the SILVIS Lab 
						in the Department of Forestry and Wildlife during my senior year at UW where we worked with the USFS to complete research into the rebuilding rates of houses after wildfires. To evaluate the 
						houses, my team and I analyzed the current and historical imagery in order to digitize the burned, untouched, and rebuilt houses in areas of previous large wildfires. Last summer, I also prepared maps
						 about DC’s development as the Research and GIS Intern at Washington DC Economic Partnership (WDCEP). For one specific map, I created during my time at WDCEP, I conducted research into the redevelopment 
						 efforts of DC neighborhoods and complied it into a map illustrating over 50 historical properties within commercial and industrial zones in DC that either could be or have been repurposed for new uses.
						  It was then highlighted on their website as their “Map of the Month” for July.  Finally, I was the President of the Geography
						Club at UW-Madison last year. Many of these projects referenced you can find on my website. Feel free to contact me with any question and/or comments. Thanks for stopping by!
